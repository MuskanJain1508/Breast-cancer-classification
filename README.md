# Breast-cancer-classification
Welcome to the Breast Cancer Classification project! This machine learning endeavor focuses on developing a model to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment, and this project aims to contribute to this by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.This project utilizes different machine learning algorithms such as SVM,DecisionÂ Tree,KNN,Logistic Regression where Logistic Regression gives the best result.
